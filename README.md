# LogRaven

## Purpose:
LogRaven is an Open Source SIEM designed to be deployable in a local space, containerized space(Docker) and a cloud space.
Currently, this SIEM will be focusing on watching and interpreting logs from various sources. In the future, I plan
to be able to create cross-referencing between log types allowing more validation and reliability. 


## Features
Current:
- Setup of file structure
- Ingestion of logs
- Log storage

In-progress: 
- Deploy-able on three different types of environments: cloud, docker and on-premise(localized)
- Searching within log storage for specific events

Future:
- RESTFUL API integration
- TBD
